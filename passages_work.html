<p><strong>Passage 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>LITERARY NARRATIVE:</strong> The following excerpt is adapted
from the short story "Unaccustomed Earth" by Jhumpa Lahiri (Â©2008
by Jhumpa Lahiri).</p>
<p>Ruma is trying to decide whether to ask her father, who is visiting,
    to move in with her family.</p>
<p>"My dad's planting flowers in the backyard," she told Adam 
        that night on the phone.</p>
<p>"Does he plan to be around to take care of them?"</p>
<p>His flippancy irritated her, and she felt defensive on her 
    father's behalf. "I don't know."</p>
<p>"It's Thursday, Ruma. How long are you going to torture yourself?"</p>
<p>She didn't feel tortured any longer. she had planned to tell Adam this,
    but now she changed her mind. Instead she said, "I want to wait a 
    few more days. Make sure everyone gets along."</p>
<p>"For heaven's sake, Ruma," Adam said. "He's your father. 
        You've known him all your life." </p>
<p>And yet, until now, she had not known certain things about him.
    She had not known how self-sufficient he could be, how helpful, to
    the point where she had not had to wash a dish since he'd arrived.
    At dinner he was flexible, appreciating the grilled fish and chicken
    breasts she began preparing after the Indian food ran out,
    making do with a can of soup for lunch. But it was her son Akash who
    brought out a side of her father that surprised Ruma most. In the
    evenings her father stood beside her in the bathroom as she gave Akash
    his bath, scrubbing the caked-on dirt from his elbows and knees. He 
    helped put on his pajamas, brush his teeth, and comb back his soft
    damp hair. When Akash had fallen asleep one afternoon on the livingroom
    carpet, her father made sure to put a pillow under his head, drape
    a cotton blanket over his body. By now Akash insisted on being read to
    at night by her father, sleeping downstairs in her father's bed.</p>
<p>The first night Akash slept with her father she went downstairs
    to make sure he'd fallen asleep. She saw a sliver of light under her
    father's door and heard the sound of his voice, reading <em>Green Eggs
    and Ham</em>. She imagined them both under the covers, their heads
    reclining against the pillows, the book between them, Akash turning
    the pages as her father read. It was obvious that her father did not
    know the book by heart, as she did, that he was encountering it
    for the first time in his life. He read awkwardly, pausing between
    the sentences, his voice oddly animated as it was not in ordinary
    speech. Still, his effort touched her, and as she stood by the door
    she realized for the first time in his life her father had fallen in 
    love. She was about to knock and tell her father that it was past Akash's 
    bed time, that he should turn out the light. But she stopped herself,
    returning upstairs, briefly envious of her son.</p>
<p>The garden was coming along nicely. It was a futile exercise, he knew.
    He could not picture his daughter or his son-in-law caring for it 
    properly, noticing what needed to be done. In weeks, he guessed,
    it would be overgrown with weeds, the leaves chewed up by slugs.
